# Code samples

This repository contains code samples from various projects

* ## Greek Postal Service API (ELTA folder)

### Description

A project for the Greek Postal Service (ELTA) where the customer can print a priority number online before getting to the physical store. 
Upon printing the number the customer gets an estimate about how long he is going to wait, his position in the queue, 
how many customers are in the store, how many employees are available and if there are seats available to sit while waiting. 
The website is fully operational, all buttons direct the user in functioning interfaces. See the [image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kostas93MJT/Code-Samples/master/ELTA/Demonstration.jpg?token=ANAPPWEC545VUTNSTEZHAOC5RNM6A) for a sneak peak.

### Files

The key files for the API in terms of the immediate interface the user sees and interacts are the files contained in the ELTA folder.
First and foremost, the ***index.html*** file contains all the stuff that the user sees and clicks on whereas the ***js/mainCode.js*** file contains the Angular controller and functions used by the app in order to manage and present the data. Finally ***js/serverCommands.php*** requests the data from the database via queries and returns it in JSON format.

It should be mentioned that these files are samples from the project and by no means are they capable of building the aforementioned platform on their own.


* ## Hellenic Open University Platform (EDUPLATFORM folder)

### Description

A Web platform and a recommendation algorithm using web and data mining technologies respectively. 
The platform was adapted to the operation of the Hellenic Open University, which is based on distance learning. 
Professors can upload educational material (files or chapters from books) and tests on the platform, arrange monthly meetings, post announcements and create polls. 
Through a user-friendly online interface, students interact with educational material uploaded by professors, evaluate their
understanding on a scale of 1 to 5 and together with their performance on various tests the tracking algorithm would determine 
their knowledge level using machine learning in order to make personalized educational material suggestions to them while informing 
professors about their students overall performance. Indexing techniques similar to those used in search engines were applied. 
The whole application was made from scratch implementing both front-end and back-end technologies 
See [images](images/ELTAhome.png) for a sneak peak.

In the current repository only the web development aspect of the project is available and not the code for the mining algorithm.
